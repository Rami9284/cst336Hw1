            <h2>Spyware</h2>
            <p> Spyware is software often put in computers to track a users private data and navegations on the web. With spyware the user is not aware of the software in their device.
                without detection. However, there is software that the user installs knowing that it can violate their privacy.</p> 
            <p>The danger of having spyware on a device, may lead to the victim's privacy being inexistent. For example, spyware is able to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access a users camera and microphone, leading to spying of nearby activity</li>
                <li>Recording of phone calls</li>
                <li>Access the victim's location</li>
                <li>Keep track of browsing history and keystrokes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The way one can notice that a device has been infected with spyware is if their is a reasonable reduction
            in network connection speeds and in mobile phones, reductions of data and battery life.</p>
